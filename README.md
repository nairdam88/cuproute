# CupRoute app for Hammerhead Karoo

TL;DR: I built this app to quickly find a good coffee shop nearby while you are on your route.

Long version: A few days ago I bought my Hammerhead Karoo 3. While exploring it, I found the excellent [`awesome-karoo`](https://github.com/timklge/awesome-karoo) curated list of extensions. I saw there is an official SDK from Hammerhead and wanted to build something right away. Since I love coffee, I built an offline coffee shop map so I can quickly find great cafes around me. I hope you like it and find it useful. ☕🚴‍♂️
